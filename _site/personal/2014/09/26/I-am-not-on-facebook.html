<p>I can write for lengths on why I am not on facebook anymore but there are others who have explained it much better. I will quote them below.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how the 45 year old explains it :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you are young you feel everyone is your &quot;friend&quot; because you
crave acceptance (people my age understand that if you have three REAL
friends you can depend on, you are fortunate) so FB seized on this
insecurity by creating &quot;friends&quot; online.  It was simple and ingenious.
I mean who doesn&#39;t want to feel popular and have friends?</p>

<p>I have a big family (12 people) and my siblings who spend more than 15
minutes a day on Facebook are, perhaps by coincidence, the much less
successful among our family.  It is my theory they migrate towards
cyber space to gain the acceptance they do not get in the real world. 
FB has created an entire universe of these type of people, and that&#39;s
just fine.  But the truth is that FB is a site where people connect
for many reasons  - mostly WRONG reasons.  I have at least a dozen
friends (make and female) who are divorced as a result of Facebook. 
For better or worse, FB creates a fantasy world where losers can be
&quot;winners&quot;.  But winners among who???  The losers mostly!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Facebook is all about wasting your time to project an image to people
you barely know, to make yourself feel better about your average life.
Nobody cares what you had for lunch, or what movie you want to see on
the weekend, you are not important, get over yourself!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are  not only pretty good reasons to leave facebook, but also,
many benefits of leaving it. The most important being that you get
plenty of time to do the stuff which you have always wanted to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently gave up facebook because I just didn&#39;t care what people
that I&#39;d met in grade school were doing now.  It is a time waster. 
And... get this - I was at a concert about 2 weeks ago and most of
them, instead of watching the band they paid money to see, they were
updating their facebook accounts.  I was kinda disgusted.  You can
either live your life or watch other&#39;s lives on your computer screen,
I suppose. Nothing worst  than hanging out with someone always
updating their account.</p>
