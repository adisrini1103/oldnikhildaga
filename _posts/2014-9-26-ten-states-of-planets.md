The astrologer, who proclaims good and bad results after a deep consideration of the ten Avasthas (states) of planets and the results arising from the different houses, never goes wrong.

***Planetary States:***

**Diptha (shining),** 
*When the planet is placed in its exaltation sign is called Diptha.*

When a planet is in Diptha state, full acquisition of the desired objects is to be foretold. 

<br>

**Dina (miserable),** 
*When it is in its debilitation sign, it is called Dina.*

If it be in the Dina state it indicates impending poverty.

<br>

**Swastha (comfortable),** 
*In its own sign, the planet is termed Swastha.*

If the planet be in the Swastha state, the object will be accomplished and there will be acquisition of wealth, fame and happiness in addition.

<br>

**Muditha (happy),** 
In a friendly sign, it is called Mudhitha.

If it be in the Mudhitha state, there will be all-round happiness, and the accomplishment of desired objects.

<br>

**Suptha (sleeping),** 
*In an inimical sign, it is called Suptha.*

If the planet be in the Prasuptha state, there will be danger and accidents etc.

<br>

**Prapiditha (troubled),** 
*When it is defeated in planetary war, it is termed prapiditha.*

If it is in the Prapiditha state, there will be troubles through enemies.

<br>

**Mushita (robbed),** 
*While it is in helical setting, it is called Mushita.*
If it be in the Mushita state, there will be loss of wealth.

<br>

**Parihiyamanavirya (with power declining),**  
*While it is approaching its debilitation sign it is named Parihiyamanavirya.*

<br>

**Pravriddhavirya (with increased vigour),**  
*While it is approaching its exaltation sign it is termed Pravriddhavirya.*

If the planet be in Pravriddhavirya state there will be aquisition of elephants, horses, gold and lands i.e. wealth.

<br>

**Adhivirya (endowed with extreme power) :**
*The planet placed in the vargas of benefics after its rising, is called Adhikavirya.*

If it be Adhivirya state, it bestows the three kinds of powers (the powers of energy, good-counsel and majesty) and extensive properties.
