![Host Blog For Free]({{site.url}}/public/images/nikhil_daga_web2.jpg)



Want to host your blog on custom domain, for free? Now, you can. By using jekyll ( a simple, blog-aware, static site generator) and github pages.

Go through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) docs to learn how to setup the blog. Initially, it may seem a bit difficult and might take some time, but believe me, in the end, it will be worth it.
