Astrological signs are the twelve 30ยบ sectors of the ecliptic.

There is a group of constellations known as the zodiacal constellations that make a ring around the Earth. To astronomers, this band is called the Ecliptic, and is the path the Sun and Moon both appear to take around the Earth. To Astrologers, this imaginary band is what governs many of our personal traits. When an astrologer says that your Sun is in Cancer, this means that at the time you were born, the Sun appeared to be in the constellation Cancer.
