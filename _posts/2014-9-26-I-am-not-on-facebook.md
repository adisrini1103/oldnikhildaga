![Not on facebook]({{site.url}}/public/images/nikhil_daga_personal1.jpg)


I am not on facebook. Here's why.
----------------------------------------------


I can write for lengths on why I am not on facebook anymore but there are others who have explained it much better. I will quote them below.


Here's how the 45 year old explains it :
> When you are young you feel everyone is your "friend" because you
> crave acceptance (people my age understand that if you have three REAL
> friends you can depend on, you are fortunate) so FB seized on this
> insecurity by creating "friends" online.  It was simple and ingenious.
> I mean who doesn't want to feel popular and have friends?
> 
> I have a big family (12 people) and my siblings who spend more than 15
> minutes a day on Facebook are, perhaps by coincidence, the much less
> successful among our family.  It is my theory they migrate towards
> cyber space to gain the acceptance they do not get in the real world. 
> FB has created an entire universe of these type of people, and that's
> just fine.  But the truth is that FB is a site where people connect
> for many reasons  - mostly WRONG reasons.  I have at least a dozen
> friends (make and female) who are divorced as a result of Facebook. 
> For better or worse, FB creates a fantasy world where losers can be
> "winners".  But winners among who???  The losers mostly!

**For better or worse, FB creates a fantasy world where losers can be winners. But winners among who??? The losers mostly! **

> Facebook is all about wasting your time to project an image to people
> you barely know, to make yourself feel better about your average life.
> Nobody cares what you had for lunch, or what movie you want to see on
> the weekend, you are not important, get over yourself!

**Facebook is all about wasting your time to project an image to people you barely know, to make yourself feel better about your average life.**

> There are  not only pretty good reasons to leave facebook, but also,
> many benefits of leaving it. The most important being that you get
> plenty of time to do the stuff which you have always wanted to.

> > "Great minds discuss ideas; 
> > average minds discuss events; 
> > small minds discuss people." 
> > -Eleanor Roosevelt

> I recently gave up facebook because I just didn't care what people
> that I'd met in grade school were doing now.  It is a time waster. 
> And... get this - I was at a concert about 2 weeks ago and most of
> them, instead of watching the band they paid money to see, they were
> updating their facebook accounts.  I was kinda disgusted.  You can
> either live your life or watch other's lives on your computer screen,
> I suppose. Nothing worst  than hanging out with someone always
> updating their account.

**You can either live your life or watch other’s lives on your computer screen**
