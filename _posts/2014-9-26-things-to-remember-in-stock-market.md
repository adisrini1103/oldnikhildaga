• Don’t overestimate the skill and wisdom of professionals.  
• Take advantage of what you already know.  
• Look for opportunities that haven’t yet been discovered and certified by Wall Street—companies that are “off the radar scope.”  
• Invest in a house before you invest in a stock.  
• Invest in companies, not in the stock market.  
• Ignore  short-term fluctuations.  
• Large profits can be made in common stocks.  
• Large losses can be made in common stocks.  
• Predicting the economy is futile.  
• Predicting the short-term direction of the stock market is futile.  
• The long-term returns from stocks are both relatively predictable and also far superior to the long-term returns from bonds.  
• Keeping up with a company in which you own stock is like playing an endless stud-poker hand.  
• Common stocks aren’t for everyone, nor even for all phases of a person’s life.  
• The average person is exposed to interesting local companies and products years before the professionals.  
• Having an edge will help you make money in stocks.   
• In the stock market, one in the hand is worth ten in the bush.
