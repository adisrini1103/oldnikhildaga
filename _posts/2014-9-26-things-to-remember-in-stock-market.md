â¢ Donât overestimate the skill and wisdom of professionals.
â¢ Take advantage of what you already know.
â¢ Look for opportunities that havenât yet been discovered and certified by Wall Streetâcompanies that are âoff the radar scope.â
â¢ Invest in a house before you invest in a stock.
â¢ Invest in companies, not in the stock market.
â¢ Ignore  short-term fluctuations.
â¢ Large profits can be made in common stocks.
â¢ Large losses can be made in common stocks.
â¢ Predicting the economy is futile.
â¢ Predicting the short-term direction of the stock market is futile.
â¢ The long-term returns from stocks are both relatively predictable and also far superior to the long-term returns from bonds.
â¢ Keeping up with a company in which you own stock is like playing an endless stud-poker hand.
â¢ Common stocks arenât for everyone, nor even for all phases of a personâs life.
â¢ The average person is exposed to interesting local companies and products years before the professionals.
â¢ Having an edge will help you make money in stocks. â¢ In the stock market, one in the hand is worth ten in the bush.
